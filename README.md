# Assignment-2.1-PHP-Web-Application
Overview
Create a new PHP page in your Mars tourism web application that displays a clock that updates every minute to show when the next trip leaves for Mars. Display different messages depending on the time left. For example, if it is less than a week until takeoff you could say "Pack your bags". Link to this new web page from the home page using a professional-looking navigation menu.  

Guidelines 
1. You must use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

2. Use control structures (if/else statements and/or loops).

3. Do not save data to files or DB. 

4. Add a professional-looking navigation menu between pages.

5.  Include thorough code comments.

6. Design a great User Experience.

Pro tip: Consider using a combination of PHP and JavaScript.
